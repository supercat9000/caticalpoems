# Patrol Duty

January 27th, 2013

I was on my usual patrol duty,

surveying my yard,

when I suddenly saw something,

it caught me off guard.


It was a squirrel,

with its tail a-twirl,

I ran with a dash,

through the puddles I splash.

Then I lost the squirrel,

but that was okay,

maybe I would get it,

another day.
